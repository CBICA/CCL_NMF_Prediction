Description:
------------
Test data to replicate CCL-NMF prediction of brain aging subtypes

!!! Please note that initial MRI images were down-sampled to 2mm^3. Accordingly, segmentation results and final CCL-NMF estimations are provided only for replication of the prediction script!

Contents:
---------
- input: Sample data (n=10) from the public IXI dataset (https://brain-development.org/ixi-dataset)
  -lists: Demographic data 
  -nifti: Down-sampled T1w Nifti scans
  -dlmuse: Segmented scans and ROI volumes

- output: CCL-NMF coefficients predicted from the ROI data

- cmd: Command for replicating the results
